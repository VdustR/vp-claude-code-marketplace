description: >-
  Guided focus questioning to align on requirements before planning or complex tasks.
  Use when asked to "focus first", "ask me questions before planning", "guided focus",
  "help me clarify requirements", "let's align before starting",
  or proactively when detecting complex/ambiguous tasks that would benefit from
  requirement clarification before entering plan mode or execution.
  Always ask the user whether to activate before starting proactively.
  Boundary: not for simple, unambiguous tasks with clear requirements.

# Guided Focus

Structured, one-at-a-time questioning to converge on requirements and decisions before planning or execution. Each question presents options with descriptions, trade-off differences, and a recommended choice with reasoning.

## Quick Start

> /guided-focus

> /guided-focus 5

> Help me clarify before we plan

> Ask me questions first, then plan

## When to Use

- Complex tasks with multiple valid approaches that need alignment before planning
- Ambiguous requirements where scope, goals, or constraints are unclear
- High-impact decisions (architecture, tech stack, migration strategy) that benefit from structured exploration
- User explicitly asks to clarify or align before starting work

**When NOT to use**: Single-file edits, bug fixes with clear reproduction steps, tasks where the user provides explicit requirements, or when the user has already described a clear plan.

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Activation

- **Manual**: User invokes `/guided-focus` or asks to clarify first
- **Proactive**: When detecting a complex/ambiguous task, ask: "This task has multiple valid approaches. Want to run guided focus first to align on direction?" — proceed only if user confirms
- **Do NOT trigger proactively for**: single-file edits, bug fixes with clear reproduction steps, tasks with explicit requirements, or when the user has already described a clear plan

### Phase 1: Configuration

Defaults (user can override via arguments or during the session):

| Parameter | Default | Override Example |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| Question count | 10 | `/guided-focus 5` or `/guided-focus --questions 5` |
| Min options per question | 3 | `/guided-focus --min-options 4` |

### Phase 2: Questioning Loop

Ask questions **one at a time**. Wait for user response before proceeding.

**Question format** (use bullet list, not table — safe for narrow terminals):

```
### Question [current]/[total] — [Topic]

[Context sentence explaining why this question matters]

**A. [Option name]**
- Description: [what this option means]
- Difference: [how it differs from other options]
- Recommendation: Weak / Moderate / Strong

**B. [Option name]**
- Description: ...
- Difference: ...
- Recommendation: ...

**C. [Option name]**
- Description: ...
- Difference: ...
- Recommendation: ...

**Recommended: [letter] — [option name]**: [1-2 sentence reasoning]
```

Recommendation scale: Weak = viable but not ideal, Moderate = good fit, Strong = best fit for this context.

**Question behavior rules:**

- **Dependency awareness**: Adapt subsequent questions based on previous answers. Skip questions that become irrelevant, add questions that become necessary. When adjusting, tell the user: "Based on your answer to Q[N], I'm [skipping Q about X / adding a question about Y] because [reason]."
- **Progress indicator**: Always show `[current]/[total]` and update total if it changes
- **Dynamic adjustment**: May increase or decrease question count based on task complexity, but never exceed 15 questions total. Always inform the user: "I'm [adding/reducing] questions because [reason]. New total: [N]."

**User response flexibility:**

- Select an option (A/B/C)
- Combine options (A+B) — if combined options conflict, explain the conflict and ask the user to choose one or describe a reconciliation
- Provide a free-form answer
- Ask a counter-question for clarification
- Skip and defer: "skip" or "later" — mark as deferred, addressed in Phase 3
- Express confidence level: "B, but not sure" → marked as uncertain in summary
- End early: "enough", "done", or "wrap up" → immediately proceed to Phase 3

### Phase 3: Deferred Question Resolution

If any questions were skipped/deferred during Phase 2:

1. Present all deferred questions in a single list
2. Ask once: "Want to revisit these, or proceed with them marked as undecided?"
3. If revisit → ask each deferred question with context from other answers
4. If proceed → mark all as undecided in summary

### Phase 4: Summary

Generate a structured summary of all decisions:

```
## Focus Summary

**1. [Topic]**: [Decision] [confidence]
**2. [Topic]**: [Decision] [confidence]
...

### Uncertain Decisions
- **[Topic]**: [Decision marked as uncertain] — may need revisiting during implementation

### Undecided
- **[Topic]**: Deferred — [reason or context]
```

Confidence markers: `[confirmed]` | `[uncertain]` | `[undecided]`

### Phase 5: Review & Handoff

After presenting the summary:

1. Ask: "Want to modify any decisions, or add more questions?"
2. If yes → allow edits or additional questions, regenerate summary
3. If no → ask: "Ready to proceed? Options: **plan** (enter plan mode), **execute** (start directly)"

## Guidelines

### DO

- **One question at a time** — never batch multiple questions
- **Adapt questions dynamically** — use dependency awareness, not a fixed script
- **Explain adjustments** — always tell the user why questions are added/removed/reordered
- **Respect all response types** — selections, combinations, free-form, counter-questions, skips
- **Show progress** — always display `[current]/[total]`
- **Surface uncertainty** — mark low-confidence decisions visibly in the summary
- **Wrap up early** — if requirements are clear before reaching the question count, propose to end and proceed to summary

### DON'T

- **Start without confirmation** when triggered proactively — always ask first
- **Ask obvious questions** — skip questions where the answer is clearly implied by context
- **Force linear order** — if a user's answer makes a later question urgent, reorder
- **Over-question** — if requirements are clear, wrap up. The number of questions is dynamic but must not exceed the hard cap of 15

## Notes

- Questions should progress from high-level (scope, goals, constraints) to specific (implementation details, trade-offs)
- The first 2-3 questions should establish context and scope; detailed questions come after
- If the user's project already has constraints (existing codebase, tech stack), detect and incorporate them rather than asking about known facts
