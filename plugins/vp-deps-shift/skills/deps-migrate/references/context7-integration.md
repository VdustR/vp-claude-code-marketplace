# Context7 Integration

Context7 provides up-to-date documentation lookup for migration guides and breaking changes. If Context7 is not available, suggest the user install it:

```
/plugin marketplace add upstash/context7
```

When available, use `resolve-library-id` + `query-docs` to look up migration guides and breaking changes for the relevant libraries. Context7 results supplement (not replace) changelog and code analysis.
